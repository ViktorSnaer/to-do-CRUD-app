# To Do App

It's a CRUD application. Create a task and set priority for the task at hand. Priority goes from low, medium, high (default being: high). Read tasks, all tasks will be displayed after submission. Priority will affect where the task will be on the display. High priority being on the top, ect. Update tasks, clicking on the task text will enable the user to update the text (updating priority is not possible). Delete task, clicking on the checkbox on the right site of the task container will delete the task.

This Application is connected to a database. Upon signing in, a document is created for the user where all their tasks/to do's are stored.

I used React/Typescript, Styled-components for most of the styling. I also used Google firebase for authentication and the database.
